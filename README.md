# Final Project Repository
In this repository, all information you need to do the research can be found.


How do you acces the data from the corpus? I will explain this in a few steps.

Step 1: Open up your Linux shell (we used Ubuntu for this on Windows 10)

Step 2: Type the following in on the command line: ssh studentnumber@karora.let.rug.nl (studentnumber is replaced with your studentnumber, for example s1234567)

Now you are in the corpus and have access to all the tweets. For the next text to acquire the data, see the two text files
names '06.txt' and '07.txt'. In these files, you see what commands we used to collect the data. If there is anything unclear
in the commands, look in the text file called 'explanation.txt'. In this file, all aspects of the commands are explained.
